# Tame Labs: Company Roadmap (2026-2028)

## 1. Mission & Philosophy

**Mission:** To build "Psychological Tooling" that helps humans override outdated evolutionary programming (The Mammoth) and empower the Authentic Voice (AV).

**Philosophy:** 
- **Cognitive Engineering:** We treat emotions as data. If you can measure the Mammoth's error rate, you can debug it.
- **Privacy First:** Mental health data is radioactive. We architect for local-first storage and zero-knowledge encryption.

## 2. Business Model: Open Core

We operate as an Open Source ecosystem with a sustainable revenue model.

1. **The Code (Open Source):** All client-side code and core logic are MIT Licensed. Anyone can self-host. This builds trust with our engineer-heavy demographic.

2. **The Product (Hosted SaaS):** "Tame Cloud". A subscription service ($5-$10/mo) that provides:
   - Cross-device sync (E2E Encrypted)
   - AI Pattern Recognition (Proprietary Layer)
   - Community Access (The "Quiet" Network)

## 3. Strategic Execution Phases

### Phase 1: The Wedge (Q1 2026 - Q2 2026)

- **Focus:** Launch **"Brier"** (formerly The 99.7% Log).
- **Strategy:** Single-player utility. Requires no network effect. Solves an immediate pain point (Anxiety) with immediate feedback.
- **KPI:** 10,000 Active Users. Prove the "Quantified Emotion" thesis.

### Phase 2: The Network (Q3 2026 - Q4 2026)

- **Focus:** Launch **"Orbit"** (Social CRM).
- **Strategy:** Once users trust us with their anxiety data, they will trust us to help them map their relationships. Brier users graduate to Orbit to prune toxic connections (Puppet Masters).
- **KPI:** Launch Tame Cloud Subscription (Sync between Brier and Orbit).

### Phase 3: The Sanctuary (2027+)

- **Focus:** Launch **"Quiet"** (Async Social Network).
- **Strategy:** Leverage the critical mass of high-AV users to create a walled garden where they can interact without Mammoth incentives (likes/views).
- **KPI:** A self-sustaining, high-value community.

## 4. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Weakness | Tame Labs Advantage |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| CBT Apps (Woebot, Sanvello) | Too medical/clinical | "Engineering/Stoic" approach |
| Social Media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn) | Designed to feed the Mammoth | The antidote |
| Productivity Tools (Notion, Obsidian) | Good for data, bad for emotion | Intersection of both |

## 5. Products

### Brier
- **Tagline:** Calibrate your fear. Debug your reality.
- **Core Function:** Prediction log for anxiety/fear calibration
- **Status:** Active development (derived from Hubble)

### Orbit
